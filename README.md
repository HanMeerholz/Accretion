# Accretion
My Intake Assignment for BUAS: a 2D game about a black hole trying to survive and thrive in space by collecting mass.

## Backstory
Once upon a time, a lone black hole—let's call him Billy—found himself in the endless, unforgiving vastness of space.
Unfortunately, things aren't as simple as they seem, as due to pesky Hawking radiation, the poor Billy keeps shrinking in size.
Billy knows that once his mass reaches a critical stage, he will too small to sustain himself.
Luckily, there are many delicious asteroids in the neighborhood, and our friend gravity is so kind to send them Billy's way.
Still, in order to catch these asteroids, Billy needs to move around. This is where you, the player, come in. You can help Billy move to catch the asteroids.
Will you help Billy survive and accrete as much mass as possible?
Do you wish life was as simple as making a number go up? Well, for Billy it is. The higher your score, the happier the life Billy will lead.
So go on and play the game; give Billy the life that he deserves!
